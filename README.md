# Java Chess Game ♟️

A basic object-oriented chess game implemented in Java as part of a university programming assignment. This project models core chess mechanics using clean OOP principles.

## ✨ Features

- Full object-oriented design using inheritance and abstraction
- Chess pieces with individual movement logic:
  - King, Queen, Bishop, Knight, Rook, Pawn
- Board setup with 8x8 grid
- Simple game simulation with at least 3 moves per side
- Console output for board visualization
- Validation for legal moves (based on simplified rules)
- Basic piece capturing logic
- JUnit tests for methods with return values

## 📦 Structure

- `ChessPiece` – Abstract base class for all chess pieces
- `King`, `Queen`, `Bishop`, `Knight`, `Rook`, `Pawn` – Concrete implementations of chess pieces
- `ChessBoard` – Handles board state, piece movement, and gameplay logic
- `Main` – Starts and simulates a basic game

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
